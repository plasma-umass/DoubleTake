* bc-1.06
program description:
---------------------
bc is an interactive calculator (GNU); it can also processes
 calculation task in *.b files.
bc 		interactive calculator
bc <file.b>   


bug explanation:
--------------------
1. heap buffer overflow
storage.c in function void more_arrays()

heap buffer array: a_names may be overflowed at line 176--line 177 loop
the root-cause is the for-loop conditio on line 176:
'indx<a_count' is mistook for 'indx<v_count'.
a_count is the number of array identifiers; v_count is the 
current number of variable identifiers. When v_count is larger than
a_count and more_arrays is called (when current array identifier quota
is used up), the bug will be triggered.

2. heap buffer overflow
util.c line 577 in function int lookup(char* name, int namekind)

in sentence: a_names[id->a_name] = name;
the id->a_name may be (one element) beyond the boundary of heap buffer a_names.
the root-cause if in line 580. if(id->a_name >= a_count) should be
if(id->a_name >= (a_count-1)) or if(next_array >= a_count) [1].

3. static fixed-length array overflow
bc.c line 1425
in the sentence: sprintf(genstr, "F%d,%s.%s[",...);
genstr is a defined as char genstr[80], the sprintf source comes from input 
file and may exceed 80 character length.

bug triggering input:
---------------------
script/bad.b can trigger all of the above 3 bugs

correct inputs:
--------------------
in inputs folder, there are a lot of non-bug-triggering input files.
They are from the original bc package.

bug detection preliminary results:
--------------------
Purify, Valgrind and CCured can all detect the bugs.
